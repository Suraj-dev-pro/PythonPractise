Write a function that takes a list of strings and returns a new list with all the strings that have at least 3 vowels.
Write a function that implements the Knapsack problem using dynamic programming. The function should take a list of items, each with a weight and value, and a maximum weight and return the maximum value that can be achieved without exceeding the maximum weight.
Write a program that simulates the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. The program should take the number of disks as input and print the steps required to solve the puzzle.
Write a function that implements the Levenshtein distance algorithm. The function should take two strings as input and return the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into the other (insertions, deletions, or substitutions).
Write a program that generates all possible combinations of a given string. For example, given the string "abc", the program should output ["a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc", "abc"].
Write a function that implements the A* search algorithm. The function should take a starting state and a goal state as input and return a list of actions that lead from the starting state to the goal state.
Write a program that solves the 8-puzzle problem using the A* search algorithm. The 8-puzzle is a sliding puzzle that consists of a 3x3 grid with 8 tiles and one empty space. The goal is to rearrange the tiles to a specific configuration using the empty space to move the tiles.
Write a function that implements the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm. The function should take two strings as input and return the longest subsequence that is common to both strings.
Write a program that solves the N-queens problem using backtracking. The N-queens problem is a classic problem in computer science in which you must place N queens on an NxN chessboard such that no two queens are attacking each other.
Write a function that implements the Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. The function should take a graph and a starting and goal node as input and return the shortest path from the starting node to the goal node.
Write a program that solves the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a genetic algorithm. The TSP is a classic optimization problem in which you must find the shortest possible route that visits a given set of cities and returns to the starting city.
Write a function that implements the Bubble Sort algorithm for sorting a list of numbers.
Write a program that reads a file and outputs the frequency of each word in the file.
Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the second largest number in the list.
Write a program that generates all possible permutations of a given string.
Write a function that takes a list of strings and returns a new list with all the strings that are palindromes (words that are the same forwards and backwards).
Write a function that implements the Merge Sort algorithm for sorting a list of numbers.
Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the mean and standard deviation of the list.
Write a program that reads a file and outputs the longest word in the file.
